# Securing email delivery

This repository is all about how to set up an email account on a dedicated domain, to follow good and solid security practices to minimize the risks of being compromised.

There are a number of initiatives, that everyone on a personal level can do - what corporate big compannies do, I will completely leave that up to them :)

## Scope

The scope of this project, is to find and configure those features that already exists today, but rarely used. My goal is to harden email delivery as much as possible, but still

- Be able to send emails to anyone - no 3rd party end-to-end encryption, that requires the receiver to make any changes on their end.
- Make it as free as possible. Will need to pay for the domain registration and maybe Google Workspace


## Todos

1. Check if it's needed to have a Google Workspace account


## Setup

1. I have registered my domain at one.com
2. I have a GitHub repository, with this information and though GitHub Pages serving the **mta-sts** functionality
3. I have a Google Workspace and gmail for my email account. 

## DKIM

## DMARC
